  There is a homotopy of immersions of $ùïä^2$ into $‚Ñù^3$ from the inclusion map to
  the antipodal map $a : q ‚Ü¶ -q$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

  This obviously follows from what we did so far.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix. A determinant of $A$ can be written as follows:
$$
  \det A = \sum_{\sigma \in \mathfrak{S}} \epsilon (\sigma) a_{1,\sigma(i)} \cdots a_{n,\sigma (n)}$$
$$
\end{theorem}
